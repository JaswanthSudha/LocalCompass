Please provide recommendations for REAL places that:
1. Actually exist at the given coordinates area
2. Match the user's query closely  
3. Are currently operational (not permanently closed)
4. Have accurate addresses and coordinates

Focus on well-known, established businesses rather than making up fictional places. If you're not certain about current status, prefer mentioning well-established chains or landmarks that are likely to still be operating.

For each place, provide realistic details that would be found on review sites like Google Maps or Yelp.`;
